Syphon Implementation for Pure Data / GEM


Alpha
========

Current implementation supports a single Server only.


Installation
============

Install both syphonserver.pd_darwin and Syphon.framework to ~/Library/Pd/ (create the folder if it doesn't already exist).

Compilation
=====

Ensure that Pure Data Extended is installed to /Applications, so that the latest GEM library is automatically found to be linked against. That is the only requirement.
